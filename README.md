# Games-From-Stratch

Final Project made for my training for Web Development at DCI - Digital Carrier Institute.

In team with:
1. Fred Bolder - https://github.com/FredBolder
2. Diana Sahlean - https://github.com/LazuliPhoenix
3. Donnie Avant - https://github.com/Dnnavant

In this project I was responsible for:
1. I was responsible to make styling for the  project. I implement the project background and all the features that you can see, so like black menu boxes seen on login and register page, all the buttons, and how game information is displayed;

2. I worked a lot on a functionality of “bal” game. I created a majority of functions that makes game working, like for example white balls moving horizonatally, red balls killing you, direction changers, teleports, game rotators and how elements change, regarding that rotation;
   
3. Third major thing that I implemented in our projects are move buttons, that you can see above the game area in bal game. They are specifically made for players, using small devices like phones and tablets;

4. I was also responsible for privacy policy page. I added this subpage to our project, but also wrote it it myself;

5. Besides that I made a small contribution on creating levels in the ball game for the big devices, and created some of the Unit Tests that we use in our project.
